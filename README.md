# Deep Competitive Pathway Network (CoPaNet)

This repository contains the code for CoPaNet introduced in the paper ["Deep Competitive Pathway Network"](arxiv link) by Jia-Ren Chang

The code is built on [fb.resnet.torch](https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch).

## Introduction
CoPaNet is a network architecture where multiple pathways compete with each other. This network architecture yields state-of-the-art accuracies on CIFAR10/SVHN. On the large scale ILSVRC 2012 (ImageNet) dataset, CoPaNet achieves a similar accuracy as ResNet, but using less amount of parameters.
